## Hello Guys &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Page 2](https://pratibharay.github.io/Pratibha-Ray/nepalese-culture)                                                                      
### Welcome to my website!
*My name is Pratibha Ray, and I am a student with a deep love and appreciation for the culture of Nepal. As a Nepalese myself, I have always been fascinated by the unique traditions, customs, and beliefs that make our culture so vibrant and beautiful. On this website, you will find a range of articles and resources that explore the rich and diverse culture of Nepal, from our colorful festivals and traditional music and dance to our mouth-watering cuisine and stunning handicrafts. I hope that my website will serve as a source of inspiration and education for anyone interested in learning more about our culture and heritage. As a student of cultural studies, I am committed to promoting cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, and I believe that sharing our culture with others is one of the most powerful ways to bridge the gap between people from different backgrounds and walks of life. Whether you are a fellow Nepalese, a cultural enthusiast, or simply curious about the world around us, I hope that my website will inspire you to explore and celebrate the beauty of Nepalese culture. Thank you for visiting, and please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or feedback. Dhanyabad!*
